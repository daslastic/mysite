I can blog now I have finally set up a proper system that makes it easy to manage. I may not blog much as I am not the extroverted type.

The site's design originated with my unhappiness related to the looks of my old site, with it having the most basic layout. I then came up with this design: a unique and frankly nice-looking design, at least to my eyes. This site initially used minimal Javascript to manage it until I found out about Zola. It made it tons easier to manage and, best of all, no Javascript. I will only use Javascript for things that require it.
