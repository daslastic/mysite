I switched to Linux because my computer kept having issues. My operating system, Windows 10, was less stable than a standing egg having many blue screens, slow to boot and use, and was reoccuring after many factory resets. 

It is much more productive in Linux as moving files, boot times, and update times are much quicker. Additionally, it's extra cutomizibility had improved my workflow, as when I switched to a Window Manager my development speeds went up by ten folds. I didn't have to drag windows around with my mouse like some monkey playing Fruit Ninja - it helps you manage it. It is Unix derived and gave me new tools only Windows Subsystem can bring me, like shell scripting and powerful terminal, replacing the traditonal File Manager.

Security, Linux is a highly secure operating system that is tough to hack. It is open-source and encourages you to use open-source for good reasons. Open-source gives anyone the chance to read the code and contribute to it, allowing everyone to contribute to it and fix any potential vulnerabilities. A hacker could not hack it since lots more people are fixing problems, making it extremely tough to find. In Microsoft, likely have many more as the few lucky CEOs can read through it. Additionally, requiring an admin password by default to install software makes it millions of times more secure as a virus would have to ask you for your password to function. The small community is not the only reason why Linux is considered safe.
