I switched to Linux because my computer kept having issues. Windows was less stable than a standing egg having blue screens, was forgetful of my settings, was slow and spied on me. These problems were reoccurring after numerous resets and installs. When I had switched to Linux, I had control over my computer. I could understand what was going on why an update is taking so long (it never does when you use a package manager).

It is much more productive in Linux as moving files, boot times, and update times were much quicker. Additionally, switching to a window manager had increased my development speed by ten folds, as I didn't have to drag windows around with my mouse like some monkey playing Fruit Ninja. It is Unix derived, giving me access to bash scripting and zsh, which are tools that help automate repetitive tasks and make you much more productive than you ever could on Windows.

Security, Linux is a highly secure operating system that is tough to hack. It is open-source and encourages you to use open-source for good reasons. Open-source gives anyone the chance to read the code and contribute to it, allowing everyone to contribute to it and fix any potential vulnerabilities. A hacker could not hack it since lots more people are fixing problems, making it extremely tough to find. In Microsoft, they likely have 
many more as the few lucky CEOs can read through it. Additionally, requiring an admin password by default to install software makes it millions of times more secure as a virus would have to ask you for your password to function. The small community is not the only reason why Linux is considered safe.
