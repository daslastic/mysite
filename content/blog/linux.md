I switched to Linux because I had to Windows has made me suffer continuously with it being less stable than a standing egg. It had blue screens, forgot my settings, was slow and spied on me. These issues were reoccurring after numerous factory resets. It was very inconsistent and was hurting my brain. When I had switched to Linux, I had control over my computer. I could understand what was going on when an update was on hold.

Productivity went way up in Linux as all is faster in terms of the software, moving files, boot times, and update times. Additionally, a window manager has increased my speed in development by ten folds, without me having to drag windows with my mouse, like some monkey playing Fruit Ninja. I have noticed that some software like Gimp, Blender, and DaVinci Resolve work much better on there.

Windows is a marketing OS to take your money out of your pocket. The only reason why Linux cannot play as many games is that asshole companies like Microsoft are in the lead and keeping the over-engineered software to themselves. Hopefully, the steam deck will help mitigate this problem.
